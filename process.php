                        <h3>Check Your Listings</h3>
                        <h2>Consistency is Key</h2>
                        <p>Listings play a huge role on your digital presence. They provide backlinks that connect to your website and promote healthy SEO. Standard directories you should be aware of are Google, Facebook, Instagram, Yelp, Twitter and Superpages. Depending on your businesses market, there could be other important directories to consider.</p>
                        <p>Do you have access to your listings? Is the data on your listings consistent across the web? Are you having trouble creating your listings? These are the important questions to reflect on.</p>

                        <p>Easy isn't always the best option. Many Agencies will use website builders to create your website within minutes. That means less effort for the agency and more issues for your business. Take a look at your website. Is it how you envisioned? Does it work properly? Do you have access?</p>
                        <p>Your website should be creative. It should be able to grab customers attention and stay in their minds. Cookie cutter website builders are not unique. Website builders also load slow, be warned.</p>

                        <p>Directories these days such as Google and Facebook have evolved in the last couple years and continue to change. Features are added yet many businesses are not aware. Having a social platform isn't just about talking to customers on Facebook, it takes effort. Is your business active on Facebook? How often do you post? Does your team respond to reviews on Google? Does your team Post on Google? </p>
                        <p>Customers like to be heard, it builds relationships. Is your business social enough?</p>
